                <h3>Aperture</h3>
                <p>In optics, an aperture is a hole or an opening through which light travels. More specifically, the
                    aperture and focal
                    length of an optical system determine the cone angle of a bundle of rays that come to a focus in the
                    image plane. An
                    optical system typically has many openings or structures that limit the ray bundles.</p>

                <h3>Shutter Speed </h3>
                <p>In photography, shutter speed or exposure time is the length of time when the film or digital sensor
                    inside the camera
                    is exposed to light, also when a camera's shutter is open when taking a photograph. The amount of
                    light that reaches the
                    film or image sensor is proportional to the exposure time.</p>
