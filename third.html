                <h2> 1. DSLR Cameras</h2>
                <p>DSLR camera is the short form of Digital Single Lens Reflex Camera. This is the most popular types of
                    cameras in the
                    market. All professional photographers will have one DSLR camera in their kit. It is actually a
                    combination of a digital

                <h2>2. Mirrorless Cameras</h2>
                <p>If you remove the optical viewfinder from a DLSR camera, then you get the mirrorless. So, the optical
                    viewfinder would
                    be missing from the mirrorless camera. This removes some amount of weight from the camera body.</p>
